# WeedML

Inspired by recent literature like [https://github.com/AlexOlsen/DeepWeeds][1] and projects such as [https://www.opensprayer.com/][1] we explore deep nets 
for weed recognition to be deployed on an autonomous spray robot.

The rover will be based on a Pixhawk PX4 controller [https://px4.io/][1] running ArduRover [https://ardupilot.org/][1] with u-Blox RTK GPS but is not complete yet.
